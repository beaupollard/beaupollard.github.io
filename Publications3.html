                <p class="pLeft">
                    The control and motion planning of bioinspired swimming robots is complicated by the fluid–robot interaction,
                    which is governed by a very high (infinite)-dimensional nonlinear system.
                    Many high-dimensional nonlinear systems, often have low-dimensional attractors.
                    From the perspective of swimming robots, such low-dimensional attractors simplify the analysis of the mechanics
                    of swimming and prove to be useful to design controllers. This paper describes such a low-dimensional model for
                    the swimming of a class of robots that are propelled by the motion of an internal reaction wheel. The model of
                    swimming on a low-dimensional attractor is itself motivated by recent work on the dissipative Chaplygin sleigh,
                    a well-known nonholonomic system, that exhibits limit cycle dynamics. We show that the governing equations of the
                    Chaplygin sleigh are a very useful surrogate model for the swimming robot. The Chaplygin sleigh model is used to
                    demonstrate certain maneuvers by the robot through computations. Experiments with such a robot provide evidence
                    of limit cycle dynamics. Computational models based on discrete-point vortex–body interaction confirm this behavior.
                    Our work also suggests that there is a close phenomenological and mathematical similarity between the dynamics of
                    swimming robots and those of ground-based nonholonomic robots, which could motivate the development of very
                    low-dimensional mathematical models for the motion of other fish-like swimming robots.

                <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                <p class="pLeft">
                    It is known that the passive mechanics of fish
                    appendages play a role in the high efficiency of their swimming.
                    A well-known example of this is the experimental
                    demonstration that a dead fish could swim upstream [1].
                    However, little is known about the role if any of passive
                    deformations of a fishlike body that could aid in its maneuverability.
                    Part of the difficulty investigating this lies in
                    clearly separating role of actuated body deformations and
                    passive deformations in response to the fluid structure interaction.
                    In this paper, we compare the maneuverability of
                    several fish-shaped robotic models that possess varying
                    numbers of passive appendages with a fish-shaped robot
                    that has no appendages. All the robots are propelled by the
                    oscillations of an internal momentum wheel thereby eliminating
                    any active deformations of the body. Our experiments
                    clearly reveal the significant improvement in maneuverability
                    of robots with passive appendages. In the broader context
                    of swimming robots, our experiments showthat passive
                    mechanisms could be useful to provide mechanical feedback
                    that can help maneuverability and obstacle avoidance
                    along with propulsive efficiency.

                <p class="pLeft">
                    Unmanned aquatic vehicles and robots are of
                    tremendous importance in a variety of applications. In this
                    paper, we present the model of an underactuated aquatic
                    robot that is propelled by an internal rotor. The propulsion
                    of the robot is based on the exchange of momentum between
                    the body and water that is mediated by the creation
                    of vorticity at the trailing edge of the robot. The robot does
                    not have any external fins, propellers, or articulated joints
                    allowing for very easy fabrication. Experimental data on its
                    locomotion and maneuverability are presented.
